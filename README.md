## How It Works 🔍

Here’s the secret sauce behind PROTON.OSINT:
- **Step 1**: We start by using the site [Pappers](https://www.pappers.fr) to search for a target via a company.
- **Step 2**: Next, we head over to [Pages Blanches](https://www.pagesjaunes.fr/pagesblanches) to potentially obtain personal information like addresses.
- **Step 3**: Everything is exported in JSON format, which can be encrypted if necessary with the tool.

## Looking for Contributors 🌍

Currently, PROTON.OSINT only supports searches in France, but we are on the hunt for contributors from other countries, especially within the EU, USA, China, Russia, and beyond.
